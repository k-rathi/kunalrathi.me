### Personal Website Challenge

I wrote the entirety of my personal challenge in straight HTML/CSS, only relying on Bootstrap 4.1 as my CSS framework library.

It's definitely not the most responsive webpage, but it gets the job done. 

To run locally, since there is no javascript you can just open the static index.html file directly. 

This page is also currently hosted at [http://kunalrathi.me/](http://kunalrathi.me/), so you can see the contents directly there.
